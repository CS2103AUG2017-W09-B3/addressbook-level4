* This is a desktop Address Book application. It has a GUI (Graphical User Interface) but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is a Java application intended for students learning Software Engineering while using Java as the main programming language.
* It is *written in OOP fashion*. It provides a *reasonably well-written* code example that is *significantly bigger* (around 6 KLoC)than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules.
* What's different from https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4[level 4]:
** A more sophisticated GUI that includes a list  panel and an in-built Browser.
**New commands have been added
**Commands can now be entered in shorthand
**Synonyms of command can now be use to complete the same task
**GUI has been improved for better readability
**Error message are now highlighted in red
**Status bar now shows number of contacts displayed
**JUnit tests have been updated for the new classes
